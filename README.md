# Daily Coding Problem

**Don't stop coding!**

This repo aims to store the obtained solutions to some coding problems usually presented in job interviews.

It will not be daily as the title assumes. Sorry for that!

## Problem 0001

- Status: Done

> Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

## Problem 0002

- Status: Done

> Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

## Problem 0003

- Status: Done

> Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

## Problem 0004

- Status: Done

> Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded. For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'. You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.
